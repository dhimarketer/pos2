POS System Blueprint V2: "Apex Retail Pro" 
Overall Philosophy 

The system is designed for security, efficiency, data integrity, and insightful reporting, operating primarily in an offline, local network environment with a centralized master database. 
I. System Architecture & Deployment 
Deployment Strategy: 

    Web Application : The POS system will be a web application accessible via any browser on terminals within the local network.
    Containerization (Docker) :
        Ensures consistency across environments.
        Provides isolation and prevents dependency conflicts.
        Simplifies deployment and updates using Docker images (docker pull your-repo/apex-retail-pro:latest).
        Enables scalability even if not immediately required.
         
    Local Server : Runs Apache2 as the web server, proxying requests to the Dockerized web app.
    Master Database Server : Hosted locally or on a dedicated internal server.
     

Master Database Architecture (Offline with Internal Connection): 

    Centralized Database : PostgreSQL or MySQL used instead of SQLite due to multi-terminal access requirements.
    Multiple POS Terminals : All terminals connect to the central DB over LAN.
    Fully Offline Clarification : Operates without internet; requires internal LAN connection to DB.
    Offline Capability :
        Local caching of critical data (e.g., items, customers).
        Transaction queueing during LAN outages with retry logic.
        Conflict resolution strategy needed for queued transactions.
         
     

Centralized Logging & Monitoring: 

    Logs, audit trails, and system events are directed to a centralized logging system.
    Options include file-based aggregation or ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for advanced monitoring.

X. Rules & Best Practices for Developers 

To ensure code quality, maintainability, and team collaboration, all developers must follow these rules: 
✅ Core Development Rules 

    Stick to the Defined Tech Stack  
        Do not introduce new languages, frameworks, libraries, or tools without approval.
        Current stack includes:
            Backend: [Python/Flask or Node.js]
            Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React/Vue optional)
            Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL
            Containerization: Docker
            Web Server: Apache2
            Logging: File-based or ELK stack (local)
             
         

    Avoid Code Duplication  
        Always check existing functions before writing new ones.
        Refactor repetitive logic into shared utilities.
         

    Use Version Control Properly  
        Commit messages must be descriptive and consistent.
        Use feature branches and require peer-reviewed PRs before merging.
         

    Follow Clean Code Principles  
        Write readable, self-documenting code.
        Keep functions small and single-responsibility.
        Follow SOLID principles where applicable.
         

    Implement Consistent Error Handling  
        Standardize API responses.
        Handle exceptions gracefully and log errors centrally.
         

    Write Unit and Integration Tests  
        Test core features and edge cases.
        Ensure coverage for transactional logic and validation rules.
         

    Maintain Transactional Integrity  
        Wrap critical operations in database transactions.
        Implement rollback for partial failures.
         

    Respect Data Validation Rules  
        Enforce all defined validation rules strictly.
        Prevent invalid states through form and backend checks.
         

    Document Functions and APIs  
        Use inline comments and documentation blocks (JSDoc, Python docstrings).
        Maintain up-to-date API docs if APIs are exposed.
         

    Secure Sensitive Operations  
        Require manager authentication for key actions.
        Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.
        Hash passwords securely (e.g., bcrypt).
         

    Test on Realistic Data  
        Use realistic sample data and test edge cases.
        Simulate offline scenarios for caching/sync testing.
         

    Review UI/UX Guidelines Before Coding  
        Align with defined interface principles.
        Avoid unnecessary complexity or clutter.
         

    Update Settings Schema Thoughtfully  
        Document new settings clearly.
        Define default values and validation rules upfront.
         

    Coordinate Across Modules  
        Communicate impacts of interdependent modules.
        Hold sync meetings before starting cross-module work.
         

    Perform Regular Code Reviews  
        Conduct peer reviews for every major change.
        Focus on readability, performance, security, and blueprint compliance.
